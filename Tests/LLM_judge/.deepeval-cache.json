If they close down, even if we have some kind of a deal, it will take time for things to [restart].\\u201d\\n\\nDespite some rerouting of China-made goods through other countries, replacing existing supply chains and shipping schedules will be difficult to achieve overnight. For 36% of U.S. imports from China, more than 70% can only be sourced from mainland suppliers, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis earlier in April.\\n\\nFor example, electronic products need to be shipped out of China by early September to hit U.S. shelves right after the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November, taking into account customs clearance and the distribution chain, said Renaud Anjoran, CEO of Agilian Technology, an electronics manufacturer in China. The Guangdong-based company delivers half of its products to the U.S. market.\\n\\nIt takes around six months to manufacture, test, assemble, and package, meaning suppliers ideally should have started preparing for these orders in March, said Anjoran.\\n\\nShrinking shipments\\nMany U.S. buyers had started stockpiling inventories since late last year, anticipating higher tariffs after Trump returned to office. As frontloading continued, China\\u2019s exports to the U.S. rose by 9.1% in March from a year ago, according to CNBC\\u2019s calculation of official customs data, while imports from fell 9.5% on year. April trade figures are expected to be released on May 9.\\n\\nBut those frontloading efforts have started to dwindle. The number of cargo-carrying container ships departing from China to the U.S. has fallen sharply in recent weeks, according to Morgan Stanley\\u2019s tracking of high-frequency shipping indicators. Cancelled shipments have also skyrocketed by 14 times in the four weeks from April 14 to May 5, compared to the period from March 10 to April 7, the investment bank said.\\n\\nIn April, a gauge of new export orders from Chinese factories fell to the lowest level since late 2022, according to the national statistics bureau.\\n\\n\\u201cCurrently, we do not have a lot of purchase orders for the next few months from American customers,\\u201d Anjoran said. Most of his clients have stockpiled inventory that was shipped to the U.S. before Chinese New Year at the end of January, with some orders trickling in March and April.\\nSome U.S. buyers are waiting to see whether tariffs will be reduced to a more acceptable level in May before resuming shipments, Ryan Zhao, a director at Jiangsu Green Willow Textile, told CNBC. For now, the company has production on hold for orders from its U.S. clients.\\n\\nRecent reports pointed to some tariff reliefs on the ground as both governments sought to blunt the economic impacts of punitive tariffs. China reportedly granted tariff exemptions to certain U.S. goods, including pharmaceuticals, aerospace equipment, semiconductors, and ethane imports.\\n\\nIn the latest relief, Trump signed an executive order exempting foreign car and parts imports from additional levies, following an earlier rollback of tariffs on a range of electronic products, including smartphones, computers and chips.\\n\\nTrying to time it right\\nDespite concerns about profit margins, some businesses are hedging their bets by partially refilling orders from China rather than enduring the sight of empty store shelves, said Tidalwave Solutions\\u2019 Johnson.\\n\\n\\u201cA few factories told me some U.S. importers have instructed them to resume production in an attempt to \\u2018time\\u2019 anticipated tariff relief,\\u201d Martin Crowley, vice president of product development at Seattle-based wholesale toy seller Toysmith, said in an email Tuesday. The company\\u2019s website urges customers to place orders by May 16, for shipping by July 31, \\u201cto lock in current, non-tariffed pricing.\\u201d\\n\\nIn the last few days, many factories in the manufacturing centers of Yiwu, Shantou, and Dongguan have received clearance from Walmart and Target to resume production, Crowley added. Walmart and Target did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.\\n\\nSome Agilian customers are also placing relatively smaller orders, betting that tariff rates will decrease by the time their products arrive at U.S. ports.\\n\\nHowever, in the event of a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade negotiations \\u2014 and a rush to backfill orders ensues \\u2014 that could drive up factories\\u2019 production costs and shipping prices.\\n\\n\\u201cIt is possible to rush, arrange production faster if quantities are not large \\u2026 but if all American customers rush at the same time, the factories are going to be overwhelmed and air shipments will be quite expensive,\\u201d said Anjoran.\", \"retrieval_context\": null}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Fluency (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.7079473738362683, "reason": "The output maintains the key points from the input, using mostly clear language without altering the overall meaning.
