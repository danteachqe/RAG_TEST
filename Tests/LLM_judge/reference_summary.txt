There are concerns about whether Christmas merchandise will be able to hit U.S. shelves in time for the prime holiday season.
For example, electronic products need to be shipped out of China by early September to hit U.S. shelves right after the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November.
Some businesses are hedging their bets by partially refilling orders from China rather than enduring the sight of empty store shelves.
